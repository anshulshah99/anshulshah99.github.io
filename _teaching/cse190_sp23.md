This was the first offering of CSE190: Working with Large Code Bases. This course was developed by Gerald Soosairaj (my advisor), Jerry Yu, Thanh Tong, and me. All four of us created the lecture content and assignments from scratch. We published [an experience report based on this first-time offering]({{ base_path }}/publications/large_code_bases_exp_report).
