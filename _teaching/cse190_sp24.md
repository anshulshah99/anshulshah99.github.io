I taught this course as the instructor of record in the Spring 2024 quarter at UCSD. This course was only developed one year earlier by my advisor, an MS student named Jerry Yu, and me, so I was responsible for expanding and developing the course materials for this class. I authored a free, online textbook, created my own lecture slides, and planned out the course syllabus. 

I learned a lot from this course in terms of how to manage and run a class. One of the most important takeaways for me was how to manage a team of teaching assistants and tutors. I could not have run this course successfully without the help of my amazing tutors: Khushi Patel, Yash Patki, and Charles Wu. 

I was pleased to see the feedback from my course being very positive. In total, 42 of the 48 students (87.5%) filled out an evaluation! The SET evaluation system at UCSD provides a rating out of 5 on three categories: student learning, course structure, and class environment. My score for each category was 4.65, 4.68, and 4.72, respectively. I have attached the full student feedback report that I received below.
