I was a teaching assistant for a 600-person introductory computer science course co-taught by my advisor, Gerald Soosairaj, and Sorin Lerner at UC San Diego. As one of the graduate teaching assistants, I played a significant role in creating assignments, labs, discussions, and other course content.
