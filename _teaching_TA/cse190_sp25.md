In this third iteration of the course, we increased our course capacity from 50 to 100 students. We introduced Peer Code Reviews in which students gave a code review of the correctness, design, and code style of a classmate's pull request. Not only did this introduce a new learning outcome of the course, but students enjoyed the process and were able to see alternative approaches to implementing their project requirements.
