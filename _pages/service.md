## Contributions to Diversity

### Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) Fellow (Spring 2022 - Spring 2024)

As described on the [3C website](https://identity.cs.duke.edu/fellows.html), "The Cultural Competence in Computing (3C) Fellows Program is a two-year, cohort-based, virtual professional development program that helps computing faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students: 1) learn more social science topics (e.g., identity, intersectionality, racism, bias, and discrimination) as well as how these topics manifest in academic environments and technologies; and 2) develop sustainable projects (courses, modules, and other activities) at their home institutions that leverage these topics, making direct connections between the biases in AI technologies and the biases in academic/professional environments, the historical contexts of both, and the long-term impacts on both technology creators and consumers."

I completed the program in [Cohort 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQagXeyFHJ40QPGYQnjX-9zYMIjbvPpJNZm3_W6OMxbLVt1D7raE5C69Rxp70r3Rk4ziA4HHSjArgpZ/pubhtml#). 

[Check out the deliverable that our group created!](https://morethancode.ucsd.edu/). The goal of this deliverable is to provide instructors with a lightweight set of lecture materials to teach their students about a particular computing concept (e.g., a software engineering concept, a machine learning concept, etc.) through a socially-responsible lens. Instructors can directly use the slides and materials we have developed in their own class. 

## Mentoring

### Student Research Mentoring

I have been involved in mentoring both undergraduate and undergraduate students during my PhD. I try to approach mentoring with a philosophy of choosing students to mentor that I feel I can truly support in their career development. I tend not to select students to mentor who already have a very strong resume with loads of experience and projects. So far, I have mentored 12 students, and four of those were part of the [ERSP research program at UCSD](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ersp/home)!

Here is a list of students I have mentored. An asterisk (*) denotes that I have co-authored a paper with that student:

* John Driscoll*
* Michael Granado*
* Fatimah Alhumrani*
* Elena Tomson*
* Charles Wu 
* Anya Chernova*
* Navyaa Gupta
* Thomas Rexin
* Gonzalo Allen-Perez*
* Luis Millan*
* Brandon Ngheim*
* Kevin Wu*

### Teaching Assistant Mentoring

I have served 3 times as a mentor for graduate teaching assistants in the CSE599 course at UC San Diego. The course is required for first-time teaching assistants. During the course, groups of 5-6 students are paired with mentors who meet with the students weekly and discuss tips, techniques, and etiquette for serving as a teaching assistant.
