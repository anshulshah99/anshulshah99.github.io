I am a fourth-year PhD student at UC San Diego, where I work to 1) improve programmers' program comprehension strategies in large code bases and 2) identify effective teaching strategies to help students learn computer science. Before starting my PhD at UC San Diego, I completed my Bachelor's degree with a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. 

My experience as an instructor-of-record involved teaching an upper-division software engineering course that I helped create called "Working with Large Code Bases" and my teaching assistant experience involves introductory programming, data science, and software engineering courses. 

In my free time, I love to surf, play board games and geography games, and cook.
