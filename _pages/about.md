I am a fourth-year PhD student at UC San Diego, where I work to improve student preparedness for a career in software engineering by studying program comprehension, code quality, and AI-assisted programming. Before starting my PhD at UC San Diego, I completed my Bachelor's degree at Duke University with a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics. 

My experience as an instructor-of-record involved teaching an upper-division software engineering course that I helped create called "Working with Large Code Bases" and my teaching assistant experience involves introductory programming, data science, and software engineering courses. 

In my free time, I love to surf, play board games and geography games, and cook.
