I am a final-year PhD candidate at UC San Diego advised by [Gerald Soosairaj](https://geraldsoosairaj.github.io/), [Leo Porter](https://leoporter.ucsd.edu/), and [Bill Griswold](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/). My research aims to enhance students' readiness for careers in software development by identifying and addressing student struggles while working on large code bases. As a result, my research focuses on program comprehension, AI-assisted programming, and code quality, encompassing elements of computing education, empirical software engineering, and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. My research to identify students' struggles in large code bases received a <b>Best Paper Award at ICER 2025</b>---a premier computing education research venue.

As an instructor-of-record, I have taught 1) an upper-division software engineering course that I co-created with Gerald called "Working with Large Code Bases" and 2) the introductory computer science course for first-time programmers. For the "Working with Large Code Bases" course, the [course website, including lecture slides](https://cse190largecodebases.github.io/sp24/), [lecture recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwefIyb96bAMPAcALGQQcTKhz7w0FsIL8&si=Ji-dwfHkjJC5mlTU), and [the free, online textbook](https://stepik.org/course/178674/syllabus) I created are all publicly available. I received the <b>2025 Doctoral Award for Excellence in Teaching</b> from the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego for my work to create and teach this course.

In my free time, I love to surf. I learned to surf when I moved to San Diego in 2021 and fell in love with the activity. I try to surf everyday, usually at Scripps Pier in La Jolla. I even took a UCSD course to shape my own, custom surfboard!

<b>In the 2025-2026 academic year, I am on the job market searching for postdoc positions, tenure-track academic positions, or industry research positions.</b>
