I was a teaching assistant, and eventually head teaching assistant, for the introductory Python course at Duke University for 6 total semesters. The courses ranged in class size from 150 to 250 students. I was responsible for creating assignments, taeching lab sections, holding office hours, and assisting with any other logistical task that Dr. Stephens-Martinez or Dr. Rodger needed.

I credit this CS101 course and my time as a teaching assistant as the primary factor for going into a PhD in computer science education. I actually entered Duke expecting to major in Political Science to eventually go to law school, but taking this course with Prof. Stephens-Martinez and becoming a teaching assistant immediately upon completing the course helped fuel my passion for teaching. This experience as a teaching assistant eventually rolled into a research experience with Prof. Stephens-Martinez when I (along with three other students for a group project) created a web-based self-assessment tool for the CS101 course and [writing a paper]({{ base_path }}/publications/cs1_reviewer_app).
