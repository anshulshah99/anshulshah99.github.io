[Teaching Evaluations]({{ base_path }}/files/SETs/FA23_11.pdf)

This is an advanced, introductory programming course taught by my advisor, Gerald Soosairaj to 600 students. The teaching staff for this course was massive (5 graduate teaching assistants and 45 undergraduate tutors), which helped me observe and learn how to manage the logistics of a 50 person course staff. We divided ourselves into teams of 1 graduate TA and 9 tutors (I was one of these graudate TAs) and took responsibility for different components of the course (programming assignments, labs, grading, etc.). 

I felt that this course truly exposed me to the challenges of teaching at scale. I found myself loving the challenging of designing course materials and policies that would be accessible to all students while still providing timely feedback to students throughout the term.
